## Control Chart for IPC

The control chart is a graph is a simple tool to evaluate how a process or product changes over time. This repository will store side projects develop in python to support in process control and/or in process monitoring for some simple manufacturying processes.

[Notebook analysis to build a XR control chart for single observation of water as a raw material](https://github.com/NguyenVu06/In_Process_Control_IPC/blob/main/Process_control_chart_XIR.ipynb)


Quick TO-DOS:
1. wrap up analysis of the above notebook
2. build an web application to automatically plot and monitor the control process. The app will return appropriate alarm as appropriate for various process deviation
